This is used for implementing API gateway.
If we have multiple microservices running on multiple port numbers, this API gateway useful to access all these microservices on one port number.

1. In gateway project, add the below reference.
	i. Ocelot
2. In startup.cs file of this project, add the methods related to ocelot.
3. Create a file called 'Ocelot.JSON', if not already there. In that file, create routes for the all the methods in all the services as follows.
	{
      "DownstreamPathTemplate": "/api/Authentication/authenticate",
      "DownstreamScheme": "http",
      "DownstreamHostAndPorts": [
        {
          "Host": "localhost",
          "Port": 55094
        }
      ],
      "UpstreamPathTemplate": "/api/gateway/Authentication/authenticate",
      "UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "Post" ]
    },
	
	"GlobalConfiguration": {
		"BaseUrl": "http://localhost:55093"
	}
	
	Here downstrem path is the original path to access that method, upstrem path is used to access the same method from the baseurl port from 
	apigateway.
